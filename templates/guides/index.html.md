Plezi is a Ruby framework for realtime web applications. It's name comes from the word "pleasure", since Plezi is a pleasure to work with.

With Plezi, you can easily:

1. Create a Ruby web application, taking full advantage of RESTful routing, HTTP streaming and scalable Websocket features;

2. Add Websocket services and RESTful HTTP Streaming to your existing Web-App, (Rails/Sinatra or any other Rack based Ruby app);

3. Create an easily scalable backend for your SPA.

## Start exploring

To your left you will find a menu with the list of available guides and demo code.

To start up, make sure you [installed Plezi](/guides/install). Next, read [the overview](/guides/basics) and try the demo code as you follow along.

If you prefer to start writing code right away, read through our [Hello World](/guides/hello_world) tutorial, as it contains much more than a simple "Hello World".

If you feel adventurous and want to start playing around with Websocket, feel free to try out the [Websocket chatroom](/guides/hello_chat) tutorial and follow along.

This should get your apetite running and you'll be peeking at our more in-depth guides in no-time.
