# Plezi Controllers - Virtual folders, RESTful requests, Websockets and more.

In the core of Plezi's framework is a smart Object Oriented Router which acts like a "virtual folder" with RESTful routing and Websocket support.

RESTful routing and Websocket callback support both allow us to use conventionally named methods in our Controller to achive common tasks. Such names methods, as will be explored further on, include the `update`, `save` and `show` RESTful method names, as well as the `on_open`, `on_message(data)` and `on_close` Websocket callbacks.

The first layer of this powerful routing system is [the Plezi's Http Router and the core method `Plezi.route` which we already explored](./routes.md).

The second layer of this powerful routing system is the Controller class which we are about explore.
