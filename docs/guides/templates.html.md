# Plezi - the Ruby framework for realtime web-apps
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/plezi.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/plezi) [![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/boazsegev/plezi.svg?branch=master)](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/boazsegev/plezi/master) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Open%20Source-blue.svg)](https://github.com/boazsegev/plezi)

Plezi is a Ruby framework for realtime web applications. It's name comes from the word "pleasure", since Plezi is a pleasure to work with.

With Plezi, you can easily:

1. Create a Ruby web application, taking full advantage of RESTful routing, HTTP streaming and scalable Websocket features;

2. Add Websocket services and RESTful HTTP Streaming to your existing Web-App, (Rails/Sinatra or any other Rack based Ruby app);

3. Create an easily scalable backend for your SPA.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plezi'
```

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plezi

## Our first Plezi Application

I love starting small and growing. So, for my first Plezi application, I just want the basics. I will run the following in my terminal:

    $ plezi mini appname

If you prefer to have the application template already full blown and ready for heavy lifting, complete with some common settings for common gems and code snippets you can activate, open your terminal and type:

    $ plezi new appname

That's it, we now have a our first Plezi application - it's a websocket chatroom (that's the starter code).

On MacOS or linux, simply double click the `appname` script file to start the server. Or, from the terminal:

    $ cd appname
    $ ./appname # ( or: plezi s )

See it work: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## So easy, we can code an app in the terminal!

The Plezi framework was designed with intuitive ease of use in mind.

Question - what's the shortest "Hello World" web-application when writing for Sinatra or Rails? ... can you write one in your own terminal window?

In Plezi, it looks like this:

```ruby
require 'plezi'
Plezi.route('*') { "Hello World!" }
exit # <- this exits the terminal and starts the server
```

Three lines! Now visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Object Oriented design is fun!

While Plezi allows us to utilize methods, like we just did, Plezi really shines when we use Controller classes.

Plezi will automatically map instance methods in any class to routes with complete RESTful routing support.

Let's copy and paste this into our `irb` terminal:

```ruby
require 'plezi'
class MyDemo
    # the index will answer '/'
    def index
        "Hello World!"
    end
    # a regular method will answer it's own name i.e. '/foo'
    def foo
        "Bar!"
    end
    # show is RESTful, it will answer '/(:id)'
    def show
        "Are you looking for: #{params[:id]}?"
    end
end

Plezi.route '/', MyDemo
exit
```

Now visit [index](http://localhost:3000/) and [foo](http://localhost:3000/foo) or request an id, i.e. [http://localhost:3000/1](http://localhost:3000/1).

Did you notice how the controller has natural access to the request's `params`?

This is because Plezi inherits our controller and adds some magic to it, allowing us to read _and set_ cookies using the `cookies` Hash based cookie-jar, set or read session data using `session`, look into the `request`, set special headers for the `response`, store self destructing cookies using `flash` and so much more!

### Can websockets do that?!

Plezi was designed for websockets from the ground up. If your controller class defines an `on_message(data)` callback, plezi will automatically enable websocket connections for that route.

Here's a Websocket echo server using Plezi:

```ruby
require 'plezi'
class MyDemo
    def on_message data
        # sanitize the data and write it to the websocket.
        write ">> #{ERB::Util.html_escape data}"
    end
end

Plezi.route '/', MyDemo
exit
```

But that's not all, each controller is also a "channel" which can broadcast to everyone who's connected to it.

Here's a websocket chat-room server using Plezi, comeplete with minor authentication (requires a chat handle):

```ruby
require 'plezi'
class MyDemo
    def on_open
        # there's a better way to require a user handle, but this is good enough for now.
        close unless params[:id]
    end
    def on_message data
        # sanitize the data.
        data = ERB::Util.html_escape data
        # broadcast to everyone else (NOT ourselves):
        # this will have every connection execute the `chat_message` with the following argument(s).
        broadcast :chat_message, "#{params[:id]}: #{data}"
        # write to our own websocket:
        write "Me: #{data}"
    end
    protected
    # receive and implement the broadcast
    def chat_message data
        write data
    end
end

Plezi.route '/', MyDemo
# You can connect to this chatroom by going to ws://localhost:3000/any_nickname
# but you need to write a websocket client too...
# try two browsers with the client provided by http://www.websocket.org/echo.html
exit
```

Broadcasting isn't the only tool Plezi offers, we can also send a message to a specific connection using `unicast`, or send a message to everyone (no matter what controller is handling their connection) using `multicast`...

...It's even possible to register a unique identity, such as a specific user or even a `session.id`, so their messages are waiting for them even when they're off-line (you decide how long they wait)! We simply use `register_as @user.id` in our `on_open` callback, and than the user can get notifications sent by `notify user.id, :evet_method, *args`.

### Websocket scaling is as easy as one line of code!

A common issue with Websocket scaling is trying to send websocket messages from server X to a user connected to server Y... On Heroku, it's enough add one Dyno (a total of two Dynos) to break some websocket applications.

Plezi leverages the power or Redis to automatically push both websocket messages and Http session data across servers, so that you can easily scale your applications (on Heroku, add Dynos) with only one line of code!

Just tell Plezi how to acess your Redis server and Plezi will make sure that your users get their messages and that your application can access it's session data accross different servers:

    # REDIS_URL is where Herolu-Redis stores it's URL
    ENV['PL_REDIS_URL'] ||= ENV['REDIS_URL'] || "redis://username:password@my.host:6389"

### Hosts, template rendering, assets...?

Plezi allows us to use different host-names for different routes. i.e.:

```ruby
require 'plezi'

host # this is the default host, it's always last to be checked.
Plezi.route('/') {"this is localhost"}

host host: '127.0.0.1' # special host, for the IP name
Plezi.route('/') {"this is only for the IP!"}
exit
```

Each host has it's own settings for a public folder, asset rendering, templates etc'. For example:

```ruby
require 'plezi'

class MyDemo
    def index
        # to make this work, create a template and set the correct template folder
        render :index
    end
end

Plezi.templates = File.join('my', 'templates', 'folder'),
Plezi.assets = File.join('my', 'assets', 'folder')

Plezi.route '/assets', :assets
Plezi.route '/', MyDemo
exit
```

Plezi supports ERB (i.e. `template.html.erb`), Slim (i.e. `template.html.slim`), Haml (i.e. `template.html.haml`), CoffeeScript (i.e. `asset.js.coffee`) and Sass (i.e. `asset.css.scss`) right out of the box... and it's even extendible using the `Plezi::Renderer.register` and `Plezi::AssetManager.register`

## More about Plezi Controller classes

One of the best things about the Plezi is it's ability to take in any class as a controller class and route to the classes methods with special support for RESTful methods (`index`, `show`, `new`, `save`, `update`, `delete`, `before` and `after`) and for WebSockets (`pre_connect`, `on_open`, `on_message(data)`, `on_close`, `broadcast`, `unicast`, `multicast`, `on_broadcast(data)`, `register_as(identity)`, `notify`).

Here is a Hello World using a Controller class (run in `irb`):

```ruby
require 'plezi'

class Controller
    def index
        "Hello World!"
    end
end


Plezi.route '*' , Controller

exit # Plezi will autostart once you exit irb.
```

Except when using WebSockets, returning a String will automatically add the string to the response before sending the response - which makes for cleaner code. It's also possible to use the `response` object to set the response or stream HTTP (return true instead of a stream when you're done).

It's also possible to define a number of controllers for a similar route. The controllers will answer in the order in which the routes are defined (this allows to group code by logic instead of url).

\* please read the demo code for Plezi::StubRESTCtrl and Plezi::StubWSCtrl to learn more. Also, read more about the [Iodine's Websocket and HTTP server](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine) at the core of Plezi to get more information about the amazing [Request](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/boazsegev/iodine/master/Iodine/Http/Request) and [Response](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/boazsegev/iodine/master/Iodine/Http/Response) objects.

## Native Websocket and Redis support

Plezi Controllers have access to native websocket support through the `pre_connect`, `on_open`, `on_message(data)`, `on_close`, `multicast`, `broadcast`, `unicast` and the Identity API (`register_as` and `notify` methods).

Here is some demo code for a simple Websocket broadcasting server, where messages sent to the server will be broadcasted back to all the **other** active connections (the connection sending the message will not recieve the broadcast).

As a client side, we will use the WebSockets echo demo page - we will simply put in ws://localhost:3000/ as the server, instead of the default websocket server (ws://echo.websocket.org).

Remember to connect to the service from at least two browser windows - to truly experience the `broadcast`ed websocket messages.

```ruby
require 'plezi'

# do you need automated redis support?
# require 'redis'
# ENV['PL_REDIS_URL'] = "redis://user:password@localhost:6379"

class BroadcastCtrl
    def index
        redirect_to 'http://www.websocket.org/echo.html'
    end
    def on_message data
        # try replacing the following two lines are with:
        # self.class.broadcast :_send_message, data
        broadcast :_send_message, data
        response << "sent."
    end
    def _send_message data
        response << data
    end
    def hello
        'Hello!'
    end
    def_special_method "humans.txt" do
        'I made this :)'
    end
end

Plezi.route '/', BroadcastCtrl
```

method names starting with an underscore (`'_'`) are protected from the Http router, even when they are public.

This is why even though both '/hello' and '/humans.txt' are public ( [try it](http://localhost:3000/humans.txt) ), `'/_send_message'` will return a 404 not found error ( [try it](http://localhost:3000/_send_message) ).

## Adding Websockets to your existing Rails/Sinatra/Rack application

You already have an amazing WebApp, but now you want to add websocket broadcasting and unicasting support - Plezi makes connecting your existing WebApp with your Plezi Websocket backend as easy as it gets.


There are two easy ways to add Plezi websockets to your existing WebApp, depending on your needs and preferences:

1. **The super easy way - a Hybrid app**:

     Plezi plays well with others, so you can add Plezi to your existing framework and let it catch any incoming websocket connections. Your application will still handle anything you didn't ask Plezi to handle (Plezi Websockets and routes will recieve priority, so your app can keep handling the 404 response).


2. **The Placebo API**:

     Plezi has a Placebo API, allowing you to add Plezi features without running a Plezi app.

     By adding the Plezi Placebo to your app, you can easily communicate between your existing app and a remote Plezi process/server. So, although websocket connections are made to a different server, your app can still send and recieve data through the websocket connection (using Redis).

### The super easy way - a Hybrid app

The easiest way to add Plezi websockets to your existing application is to use [Iodine's](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine) Rack adapter to run your Rack app, while Plezi will use Iodine's native features (such as Websockets and HTTP streaming).

You can eaither use your existing Plezi application or create a new mini plezi application inside your existing app folder using:

    $   plezi mini appname

Next, add the `plezi` gem to your `Gemfile` and add the following line somewhere in your apps code:

```ruby
require './appname/appname.rb'
```

That's it! Now you can use the Plezi API and your existing application's API at the same time and they are both running on the same server.

Plezi's routes will be attempted first, so that your app can keep handling the 404 (not found) error page.

\* just remember to remove any existing servers, such as `thin` of `puma` from your gemfile, otherwise they might take precedence over Plezi's choice of server (Iodine).

### The Plezi Placebo API - talking from afar

To use Plezi and your App on different processes, without mixing them together, simply include the Plezi App in your existing app and call `Plezi.start_placebo` - now you can access all the websocket API that you want from your existing WebApp, but Plezi will not interfere with your WebApp in any way.

For instance, add the following code to your environment setup on a Rails or Sinatra app:

```ruby

require './my_plezi_app/environment.rb'
require './my_plezi_app/routes.rb'

# # Make sure the following is already in your 'my_plezi_app/environment.rb' file:
# ENV['PL_REDIS_URL'] = "redis://username:password@my.host:6379"
# Plezi::Settings.redis_channel_name = 'unique_channel_name_for_app_b24270e2'

Plezi.start_placebo
```

That's it!

Plezi will automatically set up the Redis connections and pub/sub to connect your existing WebApp with Plezi's Websocket backend - which you can safely scale over processes or machines.

Now you can use Plezi from withing your existing App's code. For example, if your Plezi app has a controller named `ClientPleziCtrl`, you might use:

```ruby
# Demo a Rails Controller:
class ClientsController < ApplicationController
  def update
     #... your original logic here
     @client = Client.find(params[:id])

     # now unicast data to your client on the websocket
     # (assume his websocket uuid was saved in @client.ws_uuid)

     ClientPleziCtrl.unicast @client.ws_uuid, :method_name, @client.attributes

     # or broadcast data to your all your the clients currently connected

     ClientPleziCtrl.broadcast :method_name, @client.attributes

  end
end
```

Easy.

\- "But wait...", you might say to me, "How do we get information back FROM the back end?"

Oh, that's easy too.

With a few more lines of code, we can have the websocket connections _broadcast_ back to us using the `Plezi::Placebo` API.

In your Rails app, add the logic:

```ruby
class MyReciever
    def my_reciever_method arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4...
        # your app's logic
    end
end
Plezi.start_placebo MyReciever
```

Plezi will now take your class and add mimick an IO connection (the Placebo connection) on it's Iodine serever. This Placebo connection will answer the Redis broadcasts just as if your class was a websocket controller...

On the Plezi side, use multicasting or unicasting (but not broadcasting), from ANY controller:

```ruby

class ClientPleziCtrl
    def on_message data
        # app logic here
        multicast :my_reciever_method, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4...
    end
end
```

That's it! Now you have your listening object... but be aware - to safely scale up this communication you might consider using unicasting instead of broadcasting.

We recommend saving the uuid of the Rails process to a Redis key and picking it up from there.

On your Rails app, add:

```ruby
#...
class MyReciever
    def my_reciever_method arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4...
        # ...
    end
end

pl = Plezi.start_placebo MyReciever

Plezi.redis_connection.set 'MainUUIDs', pl.uuid

```
In your Plezi app, use unicasting when possible:

```ruby
class ClientPleziCtrl
    def on_message data
        # app logic here
        main_uuid = Plezi.redis_connection.get 'MainUUIDs'
        unicast main_uuid, :my_reciever_method, arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4... if main_uuid
    end
end

```

## Native HTTP streaming with Asynchronous events

Plezi comes with native HTTP streaming support (Http will use chuncked encoding unless experimental Http/2 is in use), alowing you to use Plezi Events and Timers to send an Asynchronous response.

Let's make the classic 'Hello World' use HTTP Streaming:

```ruby
require 'plezi'

class Controller
    def index
        response.stream_async do
            sleep 0.5
            response << "Hello ";
            response.stream_async{ sleep 0.5; response << "World" }
        end
        true
    end
end

Plezi.route '*' , Controller
```

Notice you can nest calls to the `response.stream_async` method, allowing you to breakdown big blocking tasks into smaller chunks. `response.stream_async` will return immediately, scheduling the task for background processing.

You can also handle other tasks asynchronously using the [Iodine's API](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/iodine).

More on asynchronous events and timers later.

## Plezi Routes

Plezi supports magic routes, in similar formats found in other systems, such as: `route "/:required/(:optional_with_format){[\\d]*}/(:optional)", Plezi::StubRESTCtrl`.

Plezi assummes all simple routes to be RESTful routes with the parameter `:id` ( `"/user" == "/user/(:id)"` ).

```ruby
require 'plezi'

# this route demos a route for listing/showing posts,
# with or without revision numbers or page-control....
# notice the single quotes (otherwise the '\' would need to be escaped).
Plezi.route '/post/(:id)/(:revision){[\d]+\.[\d]+}/(:page_number)', Plezi::StubRESTCtrl
```

now visit:

* [http://localhost:3000/post/12/1.3/1](http://localhost:3000/post/12/1.3/1)
* [http://localhost:3000/post/12/1](http://localhost:3000/post/12/1)

**[please see the `route` documentation for more information on routes](/docs/routes)**.

## Plezi Virtual Hosts

Plezi can be used to create virtual hosts for the same service, allowing you to handle different domains and subdomains with one app:

```ruby
require 'plezi'

# define a named host.
host 'localhost', alias: 'localhost2', public: File.join('my', 'public', 'folder')

shared_route '/shared' do |req, res|
    res << "shared by all existing hosts.... but the default host doesn't exist yet, so we're only on localhost and localhost2."
end

# define a default (catch-all) host.
host

shared_route '/humans.txt' do |req, res|
    res << "we are people - we're in every existing hosts."
end


Plezi.route('*') do |req, res|
    res << "this is a 'catch-all' host. you got here by putting in the IP adderess."
end

# get's the existing named host
host 'localhost'

Plezi.route('*') do |req, res|
    res << "this is localhost or localhost 2"
end
```

Now visit:

* [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/)
* [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
* [http://127.0.0.1:3000/shared](http://127.0.0.1:3000/shared) - won't show, becuse this host was created AFTER the route was declered.
* [http://localhost:3000/shared](http://localhost:3000/shared)
* [http://127.0.0.1:3000/humans.txt](http://127.0.0.1:3000/humans.txt)
* [http://localhost:3000/humans.txt](http://localhost:3000/humans.txt)
* notice: `localhost2` will only work if it was defined in your OS's `hosts` file.

## Plezi Logging

The Plezi module (also `PL`) delegates to the Iodine methods, helping with logging as well as the support you already noticed for dynamic routes, dynamic services and more.

Logging:

```ruby
require 'plezi'

# simple logging of strings
PL.info 'log info'
Iodine.info 'This is the same, but more direct.'
PL.warn 'log warning'
PL.error 'log error'
PL.fatal "log a fatal error (shuoldn't be needed)."
PL.log_raw "Write raw strings to the logger."

# the logger accepts exceptions as well.
begin
    raise "hell"
rescue Exception => e
    PL.error e
end
```
Please notice it is faster to use the Iodine's API directly when using API that is delegated to Iodine.

## Plezi Events and Timers

Plezi uses [Iodine's API](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/greactor/iodine) to help with asynchronous tasking, callbacks, timers and customized shutdown cleanup.

Asynchronous callbacks (works only while services are active and running and when using the default Iodine server):

```ruby
require 'plezi'

def my_shutdown_proc time_start
    puts "Services were running for #{Time.now - time_start} seconds."
end

# shutdown callbacks
Iodine.on_shutdown(Kernel, :my_shutdown_proc, Time.now) { puts "this will run after shutdown." }
Iodine.on_shutdown() { puts "this will run too." }

# a timer
Iodine.run_after(2) {puts "this will wait 2 seconds to run... too late. for this example"}

Iodine.run {puts "notice that the background tasks will only start once the Plezi's engine is running."}
Iodine.run {puts "exit Plezi to observe the shutdown callbacks."}
```

## Re-write Routes

Plezi supports special routes used to re-write the request and extract parameters for all future routes.

This allows you to create path prefixes which will be removed once their information is extracted.

This is great for setting global information such as internationalization (I18n) locales.

By using a route with the a 'false' controller, the parameters extracted are automatically retained.

\*(Older versions of Plezi allowed this behavior for all routes, but it was deprecated starting version 0.7.4).

```ruby
require 'plezi'

class Controller
    def index
        return "Bonjour le monde!" if params[:locale] == 'fr'
        "Hello World!\n #{params}"
    end
    def show
        return "Vous êtes à la recherche d' : #{params[:id]}" if params[:locale] == 'fr'
        "You're looking for: #{params[:id]}"
    end
    def debug
        # binding.pry
        # do you use pry for debuging?
        # no? oh well, let's ignore this.
        false
    end
    def delete
        return "Mon Dieu! Mon français est mauvais!" if params[:locale] == 'fr'
        "did you try #{request.base_url + request.original_path}?_method=delete or does your server support a native DELETE method?"
    end
end

# this is our re-write route.
# it will extract the locale and re-write the request.
Plezi.route '/:locale{fr|en}/*', false

# this route takes a regular expression that is a simple math calculation
# (calculator)
#
# it is an example for a Proc controller, which can replace the Class controller.
Plezi.route /^\/[\d\+\-\*\/\(\)\.]+$/ do |request, response|
    message = (request.params[:locale] == 'fr') ? "La solution est" : "My Answer is"
    response << "#{message}: #{eval( request.path[1..-1] )}"
end

Plezi.route "/users" , Controller

Plezi.route "/" , Controller
```
try:

* [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
* [http://localhost:3000/fr](http://localhost:3000/fr)
* [http://localhost:3000/users/hello](http://localhost:3000/users/hello)
* [http://localhost:3000/users/(5+5*20-15)/9.0](http://localhost:3000/users/(5+5*20-15)/9.0) - should return a 404 not found message.
* [http://localhost:3000/(5+5*20-15)/9.0](http://localhost:3000/(5+5*20-15)/9)
* [http://localhost:3000/fr/(5+5*20-15)/9.0](http://localhost:3000/fr/(5+5*20-15)/9)
* [http://localhost:3000/users/hello?_method=delete](http://localhost:3000/users/hello?_method=delete)

As you can see in the example above, Plezi supports Proc routes as well as Class controller routes.

Please notice that there are some differences between the two. Proc routes less friedly, but plenty powerful and are great for custom 404 error handling.

## OAuth2 and other Helpers

Plezi has a few helpers that help with common tasks.

For instance, Plezi has a built in controller that allows you to add social authentication using Google, Facebook
and and other OAuth2 authentication service. For example:

```ruby
require 'plezi'

class Controller
    def index
        flash[:login] ? "You are logged in as #{flash[:login]}" : "You aren't logged in. Please visit one of the following:\n\n* #{request.base_url}#{Plezi::OAuth2Ctrl.url_for :google}\n\n* #{request.base_url}#{Plezi::OAuth2Ctrl.url_for :facebook}"
    end
end

# set up the common social authentication variables for automatic Plezi::OAuth2Ctrl service recognition.
ENV["FB_APP_ID"] ||= "facebook_app_id / facebook_client_id"
ENV["FB_APP_SECRET"] ||= "facebook_app_secret / facebook_client_secret"
ENV['GOOGLE_APP_ID'] = "google_app_id / google_client_id"
ENV['GOOGLE_APP_SECRET'] = "google_app_secret / google_client_secret"

require 'plezi/oauth'

# manually setup any OAuth2 service (we'll re-setup facebook as an example):
Plezi::OAuth2Ctrl.register_service(:facebook, app_id: ENV['FB_APP_ID'],
                app_secret: ENV['FB_APP_SECRET'],
                auth_url: "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth",
                token_url: "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/oauth/access_token",
                profile_url: "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/me",

Plezi has a some more goodies under the hood.

Whether such goodies are part of the Plezi-App Template (such as rake tasks for ActiveRecord without Rails) or part of the Plezi Framework core (such as descried in the Plezi::ControllerMagic documentation: #flash, #url_for, #render, #send_data, etc'), these goodies are fun to work with and make completion of common tasks a breeze.


## Plezi Settings

Plezi leverages [Iodine's server](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine) new architecture. Iodine is a pure Ruby HTTP and Websocket Server built using [Iodine's](https://github.com/boazsegev/iodine) core library - a multi-threaded pure ruby alternative to EventMachine with process forking support (enjoy forking, if your code is scaling ready).

Plezi and Iodine are meant to be very effective, allowing for much flexability where needed.

Settings for the Iodine's core allow you to change different things, such as the level of concurrency you want (`Iodine.threads = ` or `Iodine.processes = `), logging destination (such as logging to a file) and more.

Settings for Iodine's Http and Websockets server, allow you to change upload limits (which can be super important for security) using `Iodine::Http.max_http_buffer =`, limit websocket message sizes using `Iodine::Http::Websockets.message_size_limit =`, change the Websocket's auto-ping interval using `Iodine::Http::Websockets.default_timeout =` or `Plezi::Settings.ws_message_size_limit` and more... Poke around ;-)

Plezi and Iodine are written for Ruby versions 2.1.0 or greater (or API compatible variants). Version 2.2.3 is the currently recommended version.

## Who's afraid of multi-threading?

Plezi builds on Iodine's concept of "connection locking", meaning that your controllers shouldn't be acessed by more than one thread at the same time.

This allows you to run Plezi as a multi-threaded (and even multi-process) application as long as your controllers don't change or set any global data... Readeing global data after it was set during initialization is totally fine, just not changing or setting it...

But wait, global data is super important, right?

Well, sometimes it is. And although it's a better practice to avoide storing any global data in global variables, sometimes storing stuff in the global space is exactly what we need.

The solution is simple - if you can't use persistent databases with thread-safe libraries (i.e. Sequel / ActiveRecord / Redis, etc'), use Plezi's global cache storage (see Plezi::Cache).

Plezi's global cache storage is a memory based storage protected by a mutex for any reading or writing from the cache.

So... these are protected:

```ruby
# set data
Plezi.cache_data :my_global_variable, 32
# get data
Plezi.get_cached :my_global_variable # => 32
```

However, although Ruby seems innocent, it's super powerful when it comes to using pointers and references behind the scenes. This could allow you to change a protected object in an unprotected way... consider this:

```ruby
a = []
b = a
b << '1'
# we changed `a` without noticing
a # => [1]
```

For this reason, it's important that Strings, Arrays and Hashes will be protected if they are to be manipulated in any way.

The following is safe:

```ruby
# set data
Plezi.cache_data :global_hash, Hash.new
# manipulate data
Plezi.get_cached :global_hash do |global_hash|
    global_hash[:change] = "safe"
end
```

However, the following is unsafe:

```ruby
# set data
Plezi.cache_data :global_hash, Hash.new
# manipulate data
global_hash = Plezi.get_cached :global_hash do |global_hash|
global_hash[:change] = "NOT safe"
```

\* be aware, if using Plezi in as a multi-process application, that each process has it's own cache and that processes can't share the cache. The different threads in each of the processes will be able to acess their process's cache, but each process runs in a different memory space, so they can't share.
