# Installation

This guide assumes you have some knowledge about Ruby, using the terminal and using `gems`.

## Installing Ruby

If you haven't installed [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) just yet, please install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) before continuing on with this guide. Using `rbenv` (or `rvm`) to install Ruby's latest version is recommended. You can [read more about installing Ruby with `rbenv` here](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation).

## Installing Plezi

To install Plezi, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plezi'
