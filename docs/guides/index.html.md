Plezi is a Ruby framework for realtime web applications. It's name comes from the word "pleasure", since Plezi is a pleasure to work with.

With Plezi, you can easily:

1. Create a Ruby web application, taking full advantage of RESTful routing, HTTP streaming and scalable Websocket features;

2. Add Websocket services and RESTful HTTP Streaming to your existing Web-App, (Rails/Sinatra or any other Rack based Ruby app);

3. Create an easily scalable backend for your SPA.

## Start exploring

To your left you will find a menu with the list of available guides and demo code.

To start up, make sure you [installed Plezi](/docs/install).

Next, read [the Getting Started overview](/docs/basics) and try the demo code as you follow along.

To learn more about using templates, Controllers and graceful error handling for Plezi's RESTful and Http features, read through our [Hello World OVERKILL](/docs/hello_world) tutorial, as it contains much more than a simple "Hello World".

Our [Websocket chatroom](/docs/hello_chat) tutorial will explain the code you saw on the landing page and show you how to leverage JSON on both the client and the server.

This should get your apetite running and you'll be peeking at our more in-depth documentation in no-time.

## The table of contents

To your right you'll find a floating "Table of Contents" for the document your reading. Hover above it with your mouse (or touch it) if you want to skip between sections of the same document.

## Please excuse us while we write

This website and the guides are fairly new and we're still writing everything down...

...and when I say that "we" are still writing everything down, it's because I invite you to join in on the writing and help document Plezi's different features.

We need editor to edit the existing documentation, writers to add more interesting tutorials and good people who are happy to help - even fixing taipos (someone, please fix this one!).
