# The Plezi Website

This is the public Plezi.io website, which publishes guides and demo code.

It's also a cool demo for a Plezi website in a production environment (although, it's a bit customized).

# Contributing

Guides are placed in the /docs/guides folder (confusing, I know... but I wanted you to find it).

When submitting guides and demo code, please submit them as github flavored markdown files, with the html type signature (`demo.html.md`). This will make guide maintenance easier in the long-run.

Remeber to add a link to your guide in the `sidebar.html.md` file.

Thanks!!!
