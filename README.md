# The Plezi Website

This (will) hold the public Plezi website for guides and demo code.

At the moment this is just a "stub" page, but it will grow.

# Contributing

When submitting guides and demo code, please submit them as github flavored markdown files, with the html type signature (`demo.html.md`).
